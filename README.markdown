# Mac App Playground

This application is just my playground to test new APIs in new versions of OSX. It doesn't do anything useful, it just demonstrates how to use the APIs, that's it. If you're interested you can take a look at the code and see how it's done.

## Used OSX APIs

From Mountain Lion:
- Notification Center (growl-like messages)
